# Consensus Robustness in Robotic Swarms
All experiments are contained in a single notebook, from which they can be run sequentially. 
Wr run the folloowing experiments:
- find probability of robust consensus.
- study how the probability of reaching robust consensus changes when varying the proportion of zealots. 
- study how the probability of reaching robust consensus changes when varying group size, with a fixed amount of zealots.   
We repeat all experiments  both with "external zealots"(the zealots are individuals outside of the total population count $N = X + Y + U$).
Then we experiment with *internal* zealots (N = X + ZX + Y + ZY + U). The results are compared in the report.
